  <p>In love with Yoga, I dedicate as much of my time as possible, practicing both physically and mentally.<br /><br />
    Currently one of the lead organisers and speaker for the GDG Milan community.<br /><br />
    Primarily focused on mobile development in my
    work and spare time, Iâ€™m enthusiast about Virtual and Augmented Reality and about everything that enhances the human
    interaction with the world through technology.<br /><br />
    Other than that, I enjoy watching TV shows, playing video games and board games, travelling and cooking.</p>
