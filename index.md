### About myself
I am a Computer Engineering student who is graduating on next october. <br>
I study and have studied at the University of Palermo, city where I'm born and where I currently live.<br>
My leading interest is in everything about the interaction between man and machine at every level, in order to integrate technology into everyday life.<br>
I enjoy every aspect of technology, from using it to creating it. I love to code for duty and for fun in my spare time.
I'm very passionate with everything concerning games development, robotics, Android programming and embedded programming with Arduino and/or Raspberry Pi. <br>
My dream is to work in the gaming/entertainment industry, focusing my work on what is needed to provide realistic and life-integrated experiences.
